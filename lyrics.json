and you'll hate yourself for being single\r\n\r\nAnd all at once it seems so nice\r\nThe folks are throwing shoes and rice\r\nYou hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map\r\n\r\nYou're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap\r\n\r\nSome starry night when her kisses make you tingle\r\nShell hold you tight, and youll hate yourself for being single\r\n\r\nAnd all at once it seems so nice\r\nThe folks are throwing shoes and rice\r\nYou hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map\r\n\r\nAnd then you wonder how it all came about\r\nIts too late now; there's no gettin' out\r\nYou fell in love, and love is the tender trap", "title": "The Tender Trap", "artist": "Ella Fitzgerald"}, {"lyrics": "We're going through the impatient years\r\nThe years when the day seems twice as long\r\nRestless and sighing and laughing and crying\r\nAnd dreaming a dream people say is wrong\r\n\r\nBut we'll journey through the impatient years\r\nTo each other's arms where we belong, clinging together\r\nI'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year\r\nBut we'll journey through the impatient years\r\n\r\nTo each other's arms where we belong, clinging together\r\nI'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year", "title": "The Impatient Years", "artist": "Ella Fitzgerald"}, {"lyrics": "The very thought of you makes my heart sing\r\nLike an April breeze on the wings of spring,\r\nAnd you appear in all your splendor,\r\nMy one and only love.\r\n\r\nThe shadows fall and spread their mystic charms\r\nIn the hush of night while you're in my arms.\r\nI feel your lips, so warm and tender,\r\nMy one and only love.\r\n\r\nThe touch of your hand is like heaven,\r\nA heaven that I've never known.\r\nThe blush on your cheek whenever I speak\r\nTells me that you are my own.\r\n\r\nYou fill my eager heart with such desire.\r\nEv'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.\r\nI give myself in sweet surrender,\r\nMy one and only love.", "title": "My One and Only Love", "artist": "Ella Fitzgerald"}]
